# condvar

Example code from my Condition Variable Class in C++blog.

## Build

1. Get the [_threads_](https://github.com/vichargrave/threads.git) code.
2. Get the [_mutex_](https://github.com/vichargrave/mutex.git) code.
3. Place the threads directory at the same directory level, e.g. `${HOME}/src/threads`, `${HOME}/src/mutex`.
4. cd to the `condvar` directory.
5. Run `make`.
6. Run the test application `condv`.
